  <ul>
  <li><p>Imagining repeating the past month of software development for 8hrs/day
and 5days/wk and 50 weeks/year for the next year. I see myself becoming more conversant with software engineering techniques, having a strong knowledge with the right technologies to use in solving issues, turning multiple ideas into digital platforms with easy and spending less time in developing Software Applications.
</p></li></ul>

  <ul>
    <li><p>I also strongly believe I will be more proficient with management, technical, and teamworking skills which are essential in Software Engineering Industry since in this area, one cannot necessarily work alone.</p></li>
