<p> <strong>Calibration task redux:</strong>  </p><br /> Takes name, outputs goals for the class <br /> Takes week number, outputs the date </p>
<h4> Description of the code </h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        The code contains the two classes tmp and student.
    </li> 
    <li>The list of the student and the goals of the student are stored in the string array in the main method of the tmp class</li>
    <li>The user is prompted to enter the name of the student and the goal of the student is displayed.</li>
    <li> In the end, the user is prompted to enter the week number then the date is printed as the week number.
     </li>
<p> <em>The string array is used to keep the goals of the class and the list of the students. In case, the user enters the student that is not in the class or list then a message is displayed on the screen that the student doesn't exist.</em></p>
