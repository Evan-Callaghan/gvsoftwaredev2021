        <h4> Class reflection: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> So far I like the direction of this class as we progress towards the end.<br>
                  The approach that we use (project-based) has helped me learn new things such as: How to use git/Github, timely managing my assignments, and also teamwork and best ways to communicate with my colleagues.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h4> Application Development:</h4>
          <ul>
                <li> Application Development is the process of developing a set of programs that will help in conducting different tasks of a business.<br> App developers are known for developing mobile and computer apps and software programmers. In addition to this, they test programs and fix bugs and issues so that the app can help in the daily functioning of its users.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4> Agile Software Development:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Agile development is a phrase used to describe methodologies for incremental software development. It is an alternative to traditional project management where emphasis is placed on empowering people to collaborate and make team decisions in addition to continuous planning, continuous testing and continuous integration.<br>
                    Even though this methodology relies entirely on a high degree of customers involvement for testing and also requires a high level of dedication and commitment. I think I like it because of it comes with advantages such as: <br>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Faster software development life cycle</li>
                          <li>Customer-focused approach</li>
                          <li>Resulting in increased customer satisfaction</li>
                          <li>Flexible in accepting changes</li
                            <li>Empowers teams to manage projects</li>
                            <li>Promotes efficient communications</li>
                            <li>Ideal for projects with non-fixed funding</li>
                      
                    </ul>
                  </li>
            </ul>
        <h4> Thoughts on David's work:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Fascinating! I have never seen Cobol programing before which kind of gave me a challenge to study it as well. I also liked the fact that he could work from home and engage with his team members. Was just wondering if he ever encountered failures in meeting deadlines when working on solutions and how do they handle them both as a team and individually.</li>
