        <p>When thinking of success, my definition will always be accomplishing a goal that I have set for myself. These goals can be very specific or broad statements of goals I have set for myself over the semester.</p>

        <p>For Software development one of the goals I planned for myself was that I could take the materials I have learned in class and apply them in a professional setting. Many technology facing companies are looking for graduates that can apply pieces of what they learned in an interview while providing real life examples. I want to show my future employers that not only was I a good learner, but I understood what was given to me and how it was used. </p>

        <p>Another goal I had was that I wanted to communicate more with my fellow students and build on my teamworking skills. Throughout my time at Grandview I have worked in group projects over Zoom and emails, but I would also like to spend more time in an in person setting. Since I see most of these other students in other classes I want to get to know them more. </p>

        <p>My final goal is what I would consider a broad goal of my semester. I want to pass the class with a good grade and have a solid understanding of Software Development to the point that it could open a new field of interest as I pursue internships and jobs. I want to succeed both in grades and personal growth. </p>
