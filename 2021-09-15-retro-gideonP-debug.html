  <h4>My Personal Retro: Gideon Kime </h4><br><br>
  <p><indent>Imagining repeating the past month of software development for 8hrs/day
and 5days/wk and 50 weeks/year for the next year. I see myself becoming more conversant with software engineering techniques, having a strong knowledge with the right technologies to use in solving issues, turning multiple ideas into digital platforms with easy and spending less time in developing Software Applications.
</p>
    <p><indent>I also strongly believe I will be more proficient with management, technical, and teamworking skills which are essential in Software Engineering Industry since in this area, one cannot necessarily work alone.
