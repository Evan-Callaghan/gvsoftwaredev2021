	<h1>Class Assignment: Running a Class Session - Evan Callaghan & Jackson Nguyen</h1>

	<h3> Our task for the class: Include a blurb description for each assignment </h3>

	Monday:

	<ul>
		<li>First, we will designate a previous class assignment to each student group.</li>
		<li>The pair will then spend the class period discussing/writing a four to five sentence description of the assignment and writing a few sentences about how they interpreted/attacked the problem at hand.</li>
		<li>At the end of the class period, every student group will share what they wrote for their designated assignment.</li>
</ul>

	Wednesday:

	<ul>
		<li>Students will spend the first five to ten minutes discussing their assignment descriptions and making the appropriate edits.</li>
		<li>Then, the assignment descriptions from each group will be randomly distributed to another group for review, edits, and suggestions.</li>
		<li>Again, we will randomly exchange assignment descriptions for review, edits, and suggestions.</li>
		<li>After two other groups have made their edits, the descriptions will be returned to the original groups.</li>
</ul>

	Friday:

	<ul>
		<li>To start the final day, groups will have five to ten minutes to discuss the suggestions and edits from other groups.</li>
		<li>Then, each group will present their final description to the class.</li>
		<li>Once everyone is happy with the assignment description, it can be added to the website as an abstract for each blog post so the reader is aware what topics are covered in the blog.</li>
</ul>
