      <p>
        By the end of the semester, I hope to understand all the topics that
      </p>
      <p>
        were covered in the class and expand my knowledge and skills in software
      </p>
      <p>
        development and coding so I can be prepared to be successful as I go on
      </p>
      <p>in my major and onto a career.</p>
