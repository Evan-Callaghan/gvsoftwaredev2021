<h4> The Assignment: </h4>
<p>Imagine repeating the past month of software development for 8hrs/day and 5days/wk and 50 weeks/year for the next year</p>
</section>

<h4> My thoughts: </h4>
        <p>What I like:<p>
        <ul>
            <li>Freedom to choose how to solve a task/problem</li>
            <li>Challenged to learn new skills to complete each task - becoming a better overall programmer</li>
            <li>Improving communication through various means (zoom, email, in person, team setting, etc)</li>
            <li>Work can be done remotely</li>
            <li>You get to build something and see the end result</li>
            <li>List I need to learn for software development: MySQL - Java - NodeJS - php - Python </li>
            <li>List for Web Developer: JS Frame work/runtimes/libraries - React+Redux - NodeJS  - Bootstrap - jQuery </li>
            <li>Master of HTML - CSS - Javascript for priority  </li>
        </ul>

        <p>What I dislike:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sometimes need more instruction on what/how to do something</li>
            <li> Easy to give up when reading the question and don't understand what is the problem to solve? 
            <li>Different experience levels slow group projects down</li>
            <li>Technical difficulties can derail a task</li>
            <li>When finish but the code doesn't work, I don't know where to look at it and have to to look back from the beginning or have to firgure it out why the code doesn't work </li>
            <li> Look for the error and fix it is the pain  </
        </ul>

<h4> Overall Thoughts: </h4>
        <p>Overall, I could see myself enjoying this as a potential career. I like that Iâ€™m being challenged to learn new things and become an overall better programmer through our assignments. I feel like I want to do for front end - because I want to design thing on the website where the user can see it. I'm enjoy to listen to the customer idea and tell me what I have to change over the process. I can change as much as they want me to change, as long as it's look perfect to them. That's the part that I always enjoy to do and to sacrifice myself
